
A classification model that classifies words into English, Spanish, Japanese, or Russian.
Words inputted as a one hot encoding of 16 characters. Input size is 432 dimensional (16*27). All words are romanized into the English alphabet plus Ã±.

Duplicates were not taken into account - for example, "abductor" is in both English and Spanish, but the model must pick only one language. However, I imagine this does not have a large effect on the results.
